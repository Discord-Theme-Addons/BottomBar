# v1.3.0
Another rework from the ground up, this one should be better this time around. For those who use [Revert Discord](https://github.com/fluffingtons/revert-discord) with this, please give me some time to add better support for that.

# v1.2.5
More padding changes to add support for something else, this preserves my sanity.

# v1.2.4
Changed positioning of some popout modals as well as fixed user area stuff (originally was broken cause i was trying to make sure it was compatible with Revamped User Area but fuck it)

# v1.2.3
Fix some width issues with the user area.

# v1.2.2
Removed where the Join / Create server positioning would change due to positioning issues on other platforms. ~~yes im too lazy to fix please so i just removed it~~

# v1.2.1
SCSS rewrite, as well as support for BD, Vizality and Web.
