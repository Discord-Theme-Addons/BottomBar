# v1.5.0
Fixed theme being broken due to class reroll.

# v1.4.0
Just a couple of changes for better customization:
- Some (hopefully) improvements and "optimizations" to make things better.
- More customization for the bar. You'll have to tinker with values, but the ability to do so is now there.
    - Please note that the bar can only be so big or so small without looking weird.
- Adjusted the default height of the bar to be thinner.
- Updated README assets.

# v1.3.0
Another rework from the ground up, this one should be better this time around.

# v1.2.5
More padding changes to add support for something else, this preserves my sanity.

# v1.2.4
Changed positioning of some popout modals as well as fixed user area stuff (originally was broken cause i was trying to make sure it was compatible with Revamped User Area but fuck it)

# v1.2.3
Fix some width issues with the user area.

# v1.2.2
Removed where the Join / Create server positioning would change due to positioning issues on other platforms. ~~yes im too lazy to fix please so i just removed it~~

# v1.2.1
SCSS rewrite, as well as support for BD, Vizality and Web.
